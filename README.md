# bouncing-game
so, this is really just an offshoot of the same idea in my bouncing-smiley repo. The only reason I made this separate is because I want to develop the bouncing smiley thing seperately. This is a similar deal to that, just with added clickiness, and later on I'll be adding more features like collision, maybe even some actual controls, this is kinda just out of the blue lol

# build instructions
using a C++ compiler of your choice, build this project with SDL2 and SDL2_images. The included makefile uses the g++ compiler. If there are any issues with building on other machines, send over the console log from your compiler and I'll try and help you out. i hope you have as much fun with this dumb program as I have so far.

# special thanks
thanks to github co-pilot for being an awesome resource to help me with my SDL. love you forever <3
